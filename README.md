# AM_FM-modulation
#### This is a Communication Systems Course project for our third year at Computer department in Faculty of Engineering Cairo University.
## In this project:
* I perform DSB-LC modulation on an audio file with Carrier Frequency = 100 kHz, Modulation index = 0.9
* Also, I perform FM modulation on an audio file with Carrier Frequency = 100 kHz, Beta = 5
